FEWD assignment 1 

## Introductions
Hi, I'm _**Bethany**_. I am excited to continue my web development journey with you all. I cleaned houses for nearly seven years and am now working in various lobbies at a busy condo association. It's energizing to interact with all of the people that come and go. I am looking to transition to a web development career by the end of this year.

I love podcasts and listened to a **TON** while cleaning. The best way I've found to discover new podcasts is to try the shows that my favorite hosts' recommend. It pretty much guarantees a whole new world of listening. 

## My Favorite Podcasts In No Particular Order
* Business Wars
* No Stupid Questions
* Ten Percent Happier
* This American Life
* Freakonomics
* The Sporkful
* Happier In Hollywood
